Description: "Visually estimated content of fibroglandular-density tissue within the breast
"
    #CentralLucent "These are rounded calcifications with a lucent center usually representing dermal calcifications. Larger calcifications with lucent centers may be due to oil cysts/fat necrosis and may follow surgery or trauma."
    #EqualDensity "X-ray attenuation of the mass is the same as the expected attenuation of an equal volume of fibroglandular breast tissue."
    #FatContaining "Includes all masses containing fat, such as oil cyst, lipoma, or galactocele as well as mixeddensity lesions such as hamartoma."
    #HighDensity "X-ray attenuation of the mass is grater than the expected attenuation of an equal volume of fibroglandular breast tissue."
    #LowDensity "X-ray attenuation of the mass is less than the expected attenuation of an equal volume of fibroglandular breast tissue."

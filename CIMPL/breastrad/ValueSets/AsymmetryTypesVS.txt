ValueSet: AsymmetryTypesVS
Description: "Currently many studies utilize cortical thickening and hilum absence as criteria for definition of the risk for metastasis(11,12-16). ... Metastatic deposits accumulate in the lymph node peripheral area, causing enlargement of the cortex, usually focal (at early stages), or uniform.

    #DensityFocalAsymmetry "By definition, a focal asymmetric density is seen on two mammographic views but cannot be accurately identified as a true mass (,,,Fig 4). Although a focal asymmetric density may represent normal breast tissue, further evaluation is often warranted to exclude a true mass or architectural distortion."
    #DevelopingAsymmetry "A focal asymmetry that is new, larger, or more conspicuous than on a previous examination."
    #FocalAsymmetry "Judged relative to the corresponding location in the contralateral breast and represents a relatively small amount of fibroglandular-density tissue over a confined portion of the breast. Refer to lexicon classification form for complete description."
    #GlobalAsymmetry "Judged relative to the corresponding area in the contralateral breast and represents a large amount of fibroglandular-density tissue over a substantial portion of the breast. Refer to lexicon classification form for complete description."

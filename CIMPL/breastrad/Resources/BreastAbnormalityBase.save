Entry: Brr_BreastAbnormalityDensity
Parent: Brr_BreastAbnormalityObservation
Description: "Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is the presence of abnormal cells inside a milk duct in the breast.
DCIS is considered the earliest form of breast cancer. DCIS is noninvasive, meaning it hasn't spread out of the milk duct and 
has a low risk of becoming invasive.

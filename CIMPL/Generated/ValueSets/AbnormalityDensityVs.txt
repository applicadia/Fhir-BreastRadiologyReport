| Code | Meaning |
|:-------------|:-----|
EqualDensity | X-ray attenuation of the mass is the same as the expected attenuation of an equal volume of fibroglandular breast tissue.
FatContaining | Includes all masses containing fat, such as oil cyst, lipoma, or galactocele as well as mixeddensity lesions such as hamartoma.
HighDensity | X-ray attenuation of the mass is grater than the expected attenuation of an equal volume of fibroglandular breast tissue.
LowDensity | X-ray attenuation of the mass is less than the expected attenuation of an equal volume of fibroglandular breast tissue.

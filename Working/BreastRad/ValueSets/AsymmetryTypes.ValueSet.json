  "description": "Currently many studies utilize cortical thickening and hilum absence as criteria for definition of the risk for metastasis(11,12-16). ... Metastatic deposits accumulate in the lymph node peripheral area, causing enlargement of the cortex, usually focal (at early stages), or uniform.",
